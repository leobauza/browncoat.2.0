browncoat has been consolidated and moved!
==================

I have figured out how to do tags and branches and all that good stuff, and realized how silly it was to make a different repo for this, links are out there in the wild though, so if you have been led here to browncoat, you can now find all of it [here at its original home.](https://github.com/leobauza/browncoat)
